<p>The BRAIN Image Library (BIL) is the data archive established to receive microscopy data from the BRAIN Initiative. Our general mission is to be the national public 
resource for microscopy data, enabling researchers to deposit, analyze, mine, share and interact with microscopy datasets of the brain. Our data scope includes: 

<ul>
<li>Whole brain microscopy image datasets and their accompaning secondary data such as neuron morphologies. 
<li>Targeted microscope-enabled experiments including connectivity between cells and spatial transcriptomics
<li>Historical collections of value to the community.
<ul>

<B>There is no-charge to contribute data to BIL or access BIL services.</b> 

<H3> Does BIL have a limit on the amount of data deposited?</h3>
BIL Does not have a limit on the abount of data deposited per-dataset or per-invesigator. If you intend to deposit in excess of 
50TB of data in a single year, we ask that you contact us in advance and discuss your data depositition plans.   
 
<H3> Does my deposited data need to be funded by the US National Institutes of Health?</h3>
Your deposited data does not need to have associated NIH funding, but the deposited data needs to be relevant to the BRAIN Initiative.  

<H3> Do you accept data from any organism? </h3>
The deposited data needs to be relevant to the BRAIN Initiative. This includes data from primates, most mammals and model organisms. 
Mice of various types are currently the most frequent type of data deposited.   

<H3>What file formats are accepted</h3>
BIL prefers image data to be deposited in tiff format, but we will also accept data in jpg-2000 format. Original propritary formats
are acceptable if they can be converted into ome-tiff using bioformats. Higher-level traced-neuron data is accepted in .swc format.

<h3>Do you accept raw or processed data?</h3>
BIL accepts both raw and processed data. Ideally, higher level (procesed) data, such as neuron tracings can be linked to the lower level data in BIL.  

<h3>How should I structure my data for submission? </h3>
A set of recommended practices have been established. Please see: <a href="http://www.brainimagelibrary.org/datadirbp.html">Submission Best Practices</a> 

<h3>Can you issue a doi for my dataset?</h3>
At the current time we can issue dois for datasets (or groupings of datasets) manually, and in the future automatically on dataset release. 
To request a doi, please contact us at bil-support@psc.edu as there is additional metadata that we will need to collect. Allow at least two 
weeks after we receive the metadata for doi issuance. 





* Provide HPC computing capability local to the data for pre-submission data processing and post-submission exploration
–	Enclave access to pre-release data 
–	Research access to restricted-access, secured data
* Provide user access and support

* Accept original microscopy image datasets from investigators. Provide text for inclusion in Resource Sharing Plans. 

* Accept higher-level datasets of other types (e.g. neuron morphologies) that are derived from or relate to image datasets housed at BIL
 
* Provide data-transfer support including network analysis to find transfer bottlenecks, a lendable portable disk (BrainBall) device and the ability to receive extremely large datasets directly on LTO8 tape.
 
* Provide download access to all public datasets. Current supported download methods include Globus and FTP.

* Provide project-only access to brain-initiative collaborations, allowing collaborators to share and operate on datasets prior to publication

* Provide stable DOIs that can be used in published literature to reference
  specific datasets or images

* Provide computational resources on which users can run applications that operate directly on BIL-housed datasets

* Host custom portals that can operate directly on BIL-housed datasets.

* Collaborate with investigators on establishing standardized formats, pipelines, and services that can be adopted and/or made available through BIL. 


In terms of data modalities. 
We provide extensive computational access through a unique High Performance Computing facility which I will be describing in a few slides. This includes, small and large memory nodes, nodes with GPUS and soon to be a Cerebras CS-1 system.  We also provide a remote-desktop environment and the capability to host unique web-interfaces to the data.

In terms of data, we are doubling the datasets that we receive about every year, and currently have about 3PB of data on disk. The overwhelming amount of data is from Mouse, with a handful of datasets from marmosets and humans.  
In terms of modalities, the majority of our datasets are slicewise image stacks from whole brain imaging experiments. The images in the middle of the screen illustrate a one of our highest-resolution mouse datasets, a whole-brain fMOST dataset contributed by Zeng Lab at the Allen Institute. 
The size of these datasets range from about 8-13TB each, and contain about 10-15,000 slices per dataset. The resolution of each individual slice is about 35 thousand pixels by 55 thousand pixels. In terms of size the x,y resolution of about .35 by .35 microns and the z spacing is about 1micron.
We receive this data on tape directly from China which we load into our system for the PI to validate on our system and ultimately submit to the archive.  
The black and white images represent the two separate channels of this data, which have been combined into the center top image. The next series of images illustrate the high-resolution nature of this data, zooming in on the boxed in region to an ultimate zoom factor of 34.  
On the right is an illustration of higher-level traced-neuron data from the fMOST image data, which we receive in .swc format. 
On the far right is an example of a patch-seq dataset from a marmoset contributed by the Feng lab. The top image shows the raw image dataset, and the bottom is showing a neuron reconstruction from the dataset. 
We currently about 7500 tracings from primary data in the archive. 





We are a collaborative project between the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, The Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center at 
Carnegie Mellon University and the Center for Biologic Imaging at the University of Pittsburgh.

The Brain Image Library (BIL) is a national public resource enabling researchers to deposit, analyze, mine, share and interact with large brain image datasets. 
BIL encompasses the deposition of datasets, the integration of datasets into a searchable web-accessible system, the redistribution of datasets, and a computational enclave to allow researchers to process datasets in-place and share restricted and pre-release datasets.
What Data is accepted: 
Any microscopy data 
File Formats: 

## Objectives
