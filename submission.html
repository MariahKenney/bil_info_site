  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>The BrainImageLibrary is currently in developmental status and running on
  temporary hardware. The Library will accept limited data to aid in the
  development of our systems, and importantly to test, diagnose and improve the
  networking speeds between the library and the data generating sites. Currently
  the library is accepting:</p>

  <p><b>Priority1:</b> Image data from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network Mouse
  Mini-Atlas project.</p>

  <p><b>Priority1:</b> Image data from BRAIN Investigators from each data generating
  site (test data).</p>

  <h4>ACCOUNTS</h4>
  <p>To deposit data an account will need to be created on our machines. To request
  an account, please send an email message to: <a href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu?subject=account">bil-support@psc.edu</a>
  with the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name
    <li>Institution</li>
    <li>Mailing Address</li>
    <li>Current email address (plus an alternate if available)</li>
    <li>Telephone number</li>
    <li>Preferred login name (at least 2 and no more than 8 characters, lowercase letters and numbers only)</li>
    <li>The BICCN or BRAIN initiative project you are associated with.</li>
    <li>Your academic (or other) status (e.g. Faculty, Research Staff, Postdoctorate, Graduate Student, Undergraduate Student, Government, Nonprofit, Industry)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Creating an account for each person within a workgroup is not a problem.
  Please include the same information listed above for each person needing an
  account.</p>

  <p>After your account is created, you will receive an email regarding your
  account and how to set the initial password on it through a special website:
  apr.psc.edu. <a
  href="https://www.psc.edu/user-resources/password-policies">Instructions on
  password policies and how to set or change your password</a></p>


  <h4>ASSISTANCE/HELP</h4>
  <p>If you need assistance please email: <a
  href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu?subject=feedback">bil-support@psc.edu</a>.
  If the issue is time-critical, you may phone the PSC hotline at:
  412-268-6350. Please note
  that we are located in the Eastern Time zone.</p>

  <h4>TRANSFERRING FILES</h4>
  We can help you get started transferring your files, and diagnose networking
  and file transfer issues. There are many supported ways to transfer files
  including sftp, scp, rsync, and Globus Online.

  <p>If you need assistance with file transfer, please email:
  <a href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu?subject=account">bil-support@psc.edu</a>
  or call the hotline.</p>

  <p>When you are ready, you may begin transferring files to
  /crucible/brain/username/ (e.g. user “jsmith” would transfer to
  /crucible/brain/jsmith/) on data.psc.edu. Be sure not to transfer into your
  home directory since that is on a much smaller filesystem.  You can use
  either scp, rsync, or sftp to transfer files or use <a
  href="https://www.psc.edu/bridges/user-guide/transferring-files#globus"
  target="_blank">Globus</a>. If you use Globus, the endpoint to use is
  psc#dxc, not the psc#bridges-xsede or psc#bridges-cilogon endpoints shown in
  the link above.</p>

  <p>The only host you can log in to with ssh is dxc.psc.edu. While you can log
  in to that machine, and use it for data transfers, please note that
  transferring files directly to dxc.psc.edu will result in a much slower
  transfer than through data.psc.edu. At the level of transferring small
  amounts (&lt;50GB/day), it probably doesn't matter.  Also, at that level we
  can do the checksums after the transfers are complete and not worry about
  doing them on the fly.</p>

  <p>By default, the files that you transfer will only be accessible by you
  (and our sysadmins) because of the protections on your
  /crucible/brain/username/ directory.  You can, of course, change those
  permissions to be group-readable/searchable with chmod.</p>

  <p>Users should consider data transferred as staged rather than submitted to
  the library. Please retain a copy of these datasets on your lab machines. We
  expect to have an easy path for your staged data to be submitted to the
  library once the permanent hardware is operational without having to
  re-transfer the data.</p>

  <h4>INTERACTIVE/COMMAND LINE ACCESS</h4>
  <p>The machine that you can access data from is called the Data Exacell
  (DXC).  New users may want to refer to the <a
  href="https://www.psc.edu/user-resources/software/seecer?id=1905"
  target="_blank">users guide</a>.</p>

  <p>There are several distinct file spaces on the DXC including:</p>

  <p>/home</p>
  <p>This is the default space for all your files. You have a home directory named
  /home/username, where username is your DXC username. The /home filesystem is
  shared across DXC, so you can access your files in /home from all DXC nodes.
  There is currently no quota on the /home file system.</p>

  <p>/crucible</p>
  <p>This is the large storage space where you transferred your data to. Your
  crucible directory is named /crucible/brain/username, where username is your
  DXC username.</p>

  <h4>FILE FORMATS</h4>
  <p>The Library will eventually harmonize data into a common image format
  (most likely OME-TIFF) and common metadata format (most likely the one
  selected by BICCN). At the current time, we are not enforcing an image file
  format standard, but <a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.3/formats/index.html" target="_blank">
  data that is convertible to the OME-TIFF format</a> will likely be the only
  data that can be submitted into the permanent library.</p>

  <p>Metadata should be uploaded in a shareable text format (can be xml, json,
  etc.) and will need eventually need to include the minimal metadata standards
  and formats (yet to be decided) for submission into the permanent library.</p>

  <h4>NETWORKING SUPPORT</h4>
  <p>If you are having networking issues related to data transfer (including
  slow transfer speeds), email us at <a
  href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu?subject=feedback"> bil-support@psc.edu</a>
  and one of our networking experts will get in contact with you.</p>
