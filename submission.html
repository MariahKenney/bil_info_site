<H1>Data Submission</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
A data contributor portal has been created to enable laboratories to submit data to the Brain Image Library. The key processes to submit data are:
<ol>
<li><a href="#Setup">Set up your submission account:</a> Setting up your submission account only needs to be done once. </li>
<ol type="A">
<li><a href="#Portal">Create an XSEDE portal account:</a> An XSEDE portal account is required to submit data. To create an XSEDE Portal Account, visit the portal website  at <a href="http://portal.xsede.org">portal.xsede.org</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="#RequestDSP">Request access to the data submission portal:</a> Visit the data submission portal and request access using your portal id. You will receive an email message once access has been enabled.  Please allow 24 hours for access to be granted.
</li>
</ol> 
<li><a href="#EnterDSP">Enter the data submission portal:</a> Using your XSEDE credentials, log into the data submission portal.
</li> 
<li><a href="#CreateCollection">Create a collection bundle:</a> Log into the portal and create a collection. 
</li>
<li><a href="#UploadImage">Upload image data:</a> Because this is time-limiting step, we suggest this step be started before entering metadata for the collection. Alternately, you may choose to upload metadata before uploading image data
</li>
<li><a href="#UploadMetadata">Upload metadata:</a>  Collection metadata may be entered directly through the portal or uploaded through the portal in spreadsheet format.
 </li>
<li><a href="#ValidateData">Validate data:</a>  At the current time, validation can only occur once all collection data (both image data and metadata) have been uploaded.
</li>
<li><a href="#ReviewSubmit">Review and submit data:</a> Please correct all errors and check all warnings in the validation log prior to submission. Collections with validation warnings may be submitted. Collections with outstanding validation errors may not.
</li>
</ol>

<H2>Submission Steps</H2>
<ol>
<li id="Setup"><b>Set up your submission account</b>
<ol type="A">


<li id="Portal"><b>Create an XSEDE portal Account</b>
<div class="card bg-light">
<div class="card-body text-center">
<p class="card-text">
At the current time we are using local PSC (DXC) accounts.  However if you have an existing PSC (DXC) account, we encourage you to create a portal account at this time if you do not already have one. A portal account, once enabled on our system will give you access to the Globus endpoint.  For best results, use your existing PSC userid as your portal ID if available.
</p>
</div>
</div> 
<p>To get an XSEDE portal ID, visit 
<a href="http://portal.xsede.org">portal.xsede.org</a> and click on the blue <span class="badge badge-info">Create Account</span> button on the left hand side of the screen. </p>

</div> 
<p>Log in to the data submission portal using your XSEDE credentials</p>
</li>

<li id="CreateCollection"><b>Create a collection bundle</b>
<p>
The next step in the submission process is to create a collection 
bundle through the portal. A collection bundle is an ingestion wrapper 
that contains one or more related datasets and metadata. (A dataset is 
a stand-alone entry (e.g. an image-volume) with metadata. A dataset can 
contain many 2d image files that are assembled computationally to form 
a more complex two or three dimensional volume.) Collections are tagged 
with common identifying metadata (such as the NIH project that the data 
is associated with) that upon submission will be propagated to each item 
in the collection. This important tagging information will allow BIL to 
report to NIH on data that has begun, but has not yet completed the 
submission process. 
</p><p>
In general, smaller collection bundles are recommended because all datasets 
within a collection must pass the validation process for the collection bundle to be accepted. 
</p>
<p>
Each collection bundle will have a unique dropbox-like landing zone 
directory associated with it (e.g. <em>/bil/lz/user/2018/07/6247417d-691a-4548-9bea-5d400045516f</em>. This landing zone directory is where the 
collections datasets must be 
transferred to for validation and ingestion processing. 
</p>
</li>


<li id="UploadImage"><b>Upload image data</b>
<p>
There are many supported ways to transfer files into the landing zone 
directory including sftp, scp, rsync, and Globus Online.

<p class="card-text">
To encourage maximal automatic metadata scraping, the library STRONGLY 
RECOMMENDS ORIGINAL FILES CAPTURED BY THE MICROSCOPE be submitted. 
The ingestion process supports native TIFF and JPEG 2000 image file formats 
as well as formats that are convertible to the OME-TIFF format via the 
bioformats tool. For more information on the bioformats tool see: <br />
<a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.3/formats/index.html">

</div> 
</li>



<li id="UploadMetadata"><b>Upload metadata</b>
</li>
<p>Metadata for each dataset can be entered manually through the contributor   
portal, or by uploading a spreadsheet to a collection via the contributor 
portal. Please see the <!-- <a href="http://c00.bil.psc.edu:8095"> --> Contributor 
Portal<!-- </a> --> for the most recent metadata specification.
</p>



<li id="ValidateData"><b>Validate data</b>
<p>Once all data has been uploaded to the landing zone area and all metadata 
has been uploaded to the contributor portal, click on the validate button 
for the collection.
</p>
<p>
The validation process will lock the dataset for changes and scrape 
additional metadata from the submitted files. When the process completes, 
a log will be available for viewing through the portal.
</p> 
</li>


<li id="ReviewSubmit"><b>Review and submit data</b>
<p>When the validation process completes, 
a log will be accessable from the contributor portal. Please examine 
this log and correctany identified warnings and errors. (note: Only an 
error will provent submission, a warning will not necessarly prevent data 
submission. select suppress warnings and resubmit.)      
</p>
<p>
Once you are satisfied that all errors and appropriate warnings have 
been corrected, select submit.

<p>
The ingestion process supports native TIFF and JPEG 2000 image file formats 
as well as formats that are convertible to the OME-TIFF format via the

</p>

<p>
<p><b>Pre-Submission Processing of Files:</b></p><p>
<p>
If you need to make corrections or do other pre-submission processing on 
one or more files after they heve been transfered to the landing zone, you 
can log in with ssh to c00.bil.psc.edu. 
</p>
<p>By default, the files in the landing zone will only be accessible by you 
and BIL support staff. You can, of course, change the permissions on the 
landing zone to be group or world readable with chmod. This may help if you 
need to share the data with others (such as other lab group members) before 
completing the submission process. 
</p>


<p><b>Assistance and Help</b></p>
<p>If you need assistance with anything, please email: bil-support@psc.edu. 
If the issue is time-critical, you may phone the PSC hotline at: 412-268-6350.
Please note that we are located in the Eastern Time zone. </p> 
<p>
If you are having networking issues related to data transfer (including 
slow transfer speeds), email us at at bil-support@psc.edu and one of our 
networking experts will get in contact with you. If network issues prevent 
data transfer, we may recommend that you send your datasets to us via an
alternate path such on our BrainBall portable device or on LTO tape.  
</p>
<p><b>Distribution Licence</b></p>
Data submitted to the library will be redistributed to others under a 
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. In 
addition, data submitters expressly permit the Library data to be 
transferred to and maintained by another open-source repository or by 
a government agency such as the US National Institutes of Health in the 
future.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Release of entries</b></p>
<p>
Data submitted to the library, by default,  will be released as soon 
as possible once data has been validated. Optionally, data submitters 
can select a limited embargo period for their submitted data of up to 
one year. 
</p>
<p><b>Assignment of DOI</b></p>
<div class="card bg-light">
<div class="card-body text-center">
<p class="card-text">
DOI's are not being issued at the current time. We expect to be able to issue 
DOI's for datasets as soon as metadata specifications are stabilized.
</p>
</div>
</div> 

A permanent, citable DOI for the submitted dataset will be created 
through Carnegie Mellon University's KiltHub. A suggested citation for 
users of the dataset will also be associated with the dataset. The DOI 
will point to a a permanent record in the KiltHub system that points 
to the dataset stored in the archive.

</p>
<p><b>Changes to entries after submission</b></p><p>
Changes may be made to submitted entries prior to release. Minor changes, 
such as updating metadata or adding citations may be made after dataset 
release. Major revisions will require the existing entry to be marked as 
obsolete and replaced by a new entry. The DOI pointing to the metadata for 
the obsolete entry may have a superseded-by field added to it to point
users to the superceded entry. There may be also be circumstances in which 
an entry in the library may be marked as withdrawn (for example, research 
misconduct). In those cases, the DOI for the obsolete entry will have a  
withdrawn field added to it.  
</p>
<p><b>Sharing data and computing on data prior to submission</b></p><p>
PSC's Bridges computational resource is an excellent place to explore and share your data with others prior to submission. The data submission landing zone path for your data on Bridges is very fast. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, public data released by the BRAIN Image Library is also available on PSC's Bridges Computational Resource. The Bridges computational resource is available through XSEDE for non-commercial research. Corporate and other users can gain access through PSC's corporate programs: <a href="https://www.psc.edu/services/corporate-programs">https://www.psc.edu/services/corporate-programs.</a> 
</p>
<p><b>Use of Pre-publication Data</b></p><p>
The Library expects all users of the submitted data to grant the authors of the data the right to publish the first paper concerning the dataset within three years of deposit. If there is no publication associated with the dataset, please contact the listed authors for permission to publish. There is no restriction on post-publication data.
