<p>This document outlines a few recommended practices to structure your data directories 
  for submission to the Brain Image Library</p> If you have questions on how to structure 
  your data uploads for a modality not covered, please contact the help desk 
  (bil-support@psc.edu).</p>
<h3>Whole brain datasets containing lower-level data</h3>
<p>To tie metadata to an image dataset (a stack of z-planes), each image dataset must be 
   uploaded in a separate subdirectory. For example, if you had an experiment containing
   5 mouse datasets (with sample names of mouse1, mouse2, mouse3, mouse4, mouse5) that
   you wanted to to include as a single ingest-collection, you would create 5 subdirectories
   in the landing zone for the collection, one for each mouse dataset. e.g:
<code>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse2
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse3
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse4
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse5
</code>
</p>
<p>If you have additional metadata that you want to include, place it in a subdirectory 
called <i>extras</i>:</p>
<code>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/extras
</code>
<p>If processed data will also be included, use subdirectories to indicate these different 
procesing levels. Recommended subdirectory names to use would be:<i>raw</i>, 
<i>unstitched</i>, <i>stitched</i>, <i>aligned</i>, and <i>tracings</i>.  (You may also
use otherdescriptive subdirectory names to segregate different processing levels if needed)
For example if stitched data, data aligned to the Allen reference) were included with mouse1:
<code>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/stitched
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/aligned
</code>
<h3>Whole brain datasets containing only higher-level data</h3>
<p>It is not unusual to make lower-level image data available before the higher-level 
analysis is complete. In this case, use the same sample name as the prior BIL submission and 
a subdirectory to indicate the level of procesing. For example, If SWC tracing files were 
provided for mouse1 above at a later date:  
<code>
/bil/lz/testuser/fef9236f6400b832/mouse1/tracings
</code>
Note that you would need to create a new collection to submit this data at a later date.
