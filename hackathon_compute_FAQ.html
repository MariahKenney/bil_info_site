      <h1>Username/Password</H1>
      If you requested an account, you should have received an email from grants@psc.edu with your username and 
      instructions on how to <a href="https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/password.html">change your password</a>. 
      <i>All BIL systems use the same username and password.<i>
      If you can not find the email or do not know what your username is, please email bil-support@psc.edu for assistance.
      
        
      <H1>Hackathon Data</H1>
      The BIL Filesystem, which is a lustre based filesystem, is mounted on all BIL systems at: /bil . 
      The hackathon data itself can be found at:  /bil/proj/hackathon/2022_GYBS/
        
      <H1>BIL Hackathon Tutorial</H1>
      We highly recommend that users <a href="https://hackmd.io/@biomed-apps/B1B8mQCb5">review the BIL 
      hackathon tutorial</a>. The BIL Hackathon tutorial goes over several items to be aware of using 
      the BIL environment. If you haven't used them before,  LMOD and SLURM are the two <i>most important</i>
      items to review and understand from the tutorial: 
        <ul>
        <li>SLURM is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
          scheduling system.</li>
        <li>LMOD is software to manage software emvironments. It is used to make software available for use. 
        </ul>
        The hackathon tutorial also goes into detail outlining several ways to containerize codes and also
        gives examples on how to run select software packages on the BIL system including MATLAB.  
      
      <h1>Analysis Ecosystem</H1>
      <p>The Brain Image Library analysis ecosystem provides an integrated computational and visualization system to  
      explore, visualize, and and access data without having to download it. It consists of several parts including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>BIL Login Node:</b> <i>login.brainimagelibrary.org</i> The BIL login node provides command line, secure 
          shell (ssh) terminal access to BIL data.  The login node is 
          not intended for heavy computation or visualization, but rather to provide convenient shell access to
	  BIL data and enable interactive and batch use of the <i>BIL Computational Cluster</i>.Connect using secure shell. ssh access to the BIL login node<./li>
        <li><b>BIL Workshop Node:</b> The BIL Workshop node  . To run graphical applications, we recommend that you 
          connect using <a href="software/X2Go.html">X2Go</a> 
        <li><b>BIL Workshop GPU Node:</b> The BIL Workshop GPU node. The BIL workshop GPU node contains two V100 GPUS. 
          To run graphical applications that use the GPUs, we recommend that you connect using <a href="software/X2Go.html">X2Go</a>  
	      <li><b>BIL Computational Cluster:</b> The BIL Computational cluster consists of eight nodes 
	         with 3 terabytes of RAM each. The computational cluster runs SLURM and is avaiable for 
          both batch and interactive access from the <u>BIL login node</u> and the <u>BIL Workshop Node</u>.</li>       
        <li><b>BIL VM System:</b>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
          memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
          user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
          web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</li> 
       
      <div id="login"></div>
      <h3>BIL Login Node</h3>    
        <p>The BIL login node provides command line (ssh terminal) access to BIL data. Everyone who requests
          a BIL account has access to the login node using their BIL Username and Password. The login node is 
          not intended for heavy computation or visualization, but rather to provide convenient shell access to
	  BIL data and enable interactive and batch use of the <i>BIL Computational Cluster</i>. The BIL 
	  computational cluster provides a suitable resource for both computation and visualization.</p>
        <p>To request a BIL account and gain access to the login node, follow 
          <a href="http://www.brainimagelibrary.org/XSEDEportal.html">these instructions</a> to create an 
	        XSEDE portal Account. Then, send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> along with your XSEDE Portal Account 
          and the subject "Access to BIL Login Node for data exploration". You will receive an email message 
          once access has been enabled with instructions to set your password. Please allow 24 hours for access
          to be granted.</p> 
        <p> Once access has been granted you may connect using ssh to login.brainimagelibrary.org and log in 
          with your username/password combination.</p>
 
      <h3>BIL VM System</h3>
			  <p>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
	        memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
          user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
	        web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
	      <p>The VM system can be set up to support two different remote-desktop models: X2Go and for high-resolution
		      graphics TGX.</a>
        <p>There is a rich suite of open-source and commercial software availiable on the VMs through the 
				  modules package. The suite available includes:  C/C++, Java, Python, R, Matlab, Fiji, Vaa3d, and others.
				<p>VMs can also be configured to host web gateways to provide project specific views of data in BIL and 
					to support visualization, APIs, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
			  <p>Since customization is involved, existing BIL users should send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> 
				  describing their proposed VM usage. BIL staff will then contact the enailer and set up a time to 
          discuss various VM options in more detail. </p>
      
      <H3>Bridges-2 HPC Access</h3> 
          <p>The Brain Image Library data (the /bil filesystem) is directly accessable
            on the Bridges-2 Platform (bridges2.psc.edu)</b></p>
          <p>The Bridges-2 system  is a high performance computing system designed to support
            familiar, convenient software and environments for both traditional and non-traditional 
            HPC users. Bridges-2 is the ideal system for resource-intensive applications as well
