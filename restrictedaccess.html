<h1>Access to Restricted Data</h1>

<p><b>Access to all restricted data is controlled by the data 
contributor/project
leader. This section provides an overview of the process to 
grant and gain access to different types of restricted datasets.

<li id="#PREnable">Enabling Access:</a> How the project leader can set up 
pre-release access.</li>
<p>Data contributors and project leaders of large projects can request 
private project space on BIL to store pre-release data for pre-release 
processing and pre-release data sharing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To set up data sharing: The data contributor/project leader must have 
an XSEDE Portal account 
(<a href="http://portal.xsede.org/">create one here if you don't already 
have one</a>)</li>
<li>The data contributor/project leader should send an email request to:
bil-support@psc.edu. This request should include the following information:
<ul>
<li>The project leader's XSEDE portal accounts</li>
<li>The amount of project space needed</li>
<li>The XSEDE portal accounts for those that need read/write/delete 
access to the project space. (If you do not have these at this time, they
can be added at a later time.)</li>
<li>The XSEDE portal accounts for those that need read-only  
permission. (If you do not have these at this time, they
can be added at a later time.)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To set up data sharing with Bridges computational access: The data contributor/project leader must have an XSEDE Portal account 
(<a href="http://portal.xsede.org/">create one here if you don't already 
have one</a>)</li>
<li>The data contributor/project leader should <a href="compute.html#apply">apply for access to bridges by following these instructions</a>.</li>
