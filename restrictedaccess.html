<h1>Access to Restricted Data</h1>

<p><b>Access to all restricted data is controlled by the data 
contributor/project
leader. This section provides an overview of the process to 
grant and gain access to different types of restricted datasets.

<li id="#PREnable">Enabling Access:</a> How the project leader can set up 
pre-release access.</li>
<p>Data contributors/project leaders can request private project space on 
BIL to store pre-release data for pre-release processing and pre-release 
data sharing. To enable sharing, two special groups will be set up on the 
system: a read/write/delete group and a readonly group.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li id="#NoCompute">To set up data sharing without Bridges computational 
access</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>The data contributor/project leader must have an XSEDE Portal account 
(<a href="http://portal.xsede.org/">create one here if you don't already 
have one</a>)</li>
<li>The data contributor/project leader should send an email request to:
<a href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu">bil-support@psc.edu</a>. 
This request should include the following information:
<ul>
<li>The project leader's XSEDE portal accounts</li>
<li>The amount of project space needed</li>
<li>The XSEDE portal accounts for those that need read/write/delete 
access to the project space. (If you do not have these at this time, they
can be added at a later time by sending email with the portal accounts to 
be added.)</li>
<li>The XSEDE portal accounts for those that need read-only  
permission. (If you do not have these at this time, they
can be added at a later time by sending email with the portal accounts to 
be added.)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Your shared project space will be created down the following path: 
<i>/bil/proj/&lt;projectname&gt;</i> where <i>&lt;projectname&gt;</i> is 
the projectname for the project. </li>
<li>The shared project space is accessable to authorized users with 
authenticated access via sftp, scp, rsync and globus:</li>
<ul>
<li>Using sftp to submit.brainimagelibrary.org: An example logging into the project space as testuser@submit.brainimagelibrary.org is shown below. The put command is used to upload data (test1.tiff) and the get command is used to download data (test2.tiff):

<li>Using Globus: Login to the Globus transfer web service at www.globus.org. 
Select an Endpoint field and select 'Brain Image Library Download' 
(a shortcut is available as bil#download). Upon successful connection to 
the Brain Image Library Download server, you will land in the /bil/data directory, which lists the first layer of the 00..ff directory hierarchy. Navigate (or type the path in the Path field) to the directory containing the dataset(s) that you wish to download.
