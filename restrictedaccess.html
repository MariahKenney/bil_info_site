<p><b>Access to all restricted data is controlled by the data 
contributor/project
leader. This section provides an overview of the process to 
grant and gain access to different types of restricted datasets.

<li id="#PREnable">Enabling Access:</a> How the project leader can set up 
pre-release access.</li>
<p>Data contributors/project leaders can request private project space on 
BIL to store pre-release data for pre-release processing and pre-release 
data sharing. To enable sharing, two special groups will be set up on the 
system: a read/write/delete group and a readonly group.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li id="#NoCompute">To set up data sharing without Bridges computational 
access</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>The data contributor/project leader must have an XSEDE Portal account 
(<a href="http://portal.xsede.org/">create one here if you don't already 
have one</a>)</li>
<li>The data contributor/project leader should send an email request to:
<a href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu">bil-support@psc.edu</a>. 
This request should include the following information:
<ul>
<li>The project leader's XSEDE portal accounts</li>
<li>The amount of project space needed</li>
<li>The XSEDE portal accounts for those that need read/write/delete 
access to the project space. (If you do not have these at this time, they
can be added at a later time by sending email with the portal accounts to
