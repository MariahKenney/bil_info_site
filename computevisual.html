      <p>BIL provides several ways to access data without having to download it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>BIL Login Node:</em>All users of the BIL systems have ssh access to the BIL login nodes</li>
        <li><em>BIL VM System:</em>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
          memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
          user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
          web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</li> 
        <li><em>HPC Access through Bridges-2</em> Bridges-2 is a high performance computing system designed 
          to support familiar, convenient software and environments for both traditional and non-traditional 
          HPC users. Its richly-connected set of interacting systems offers exceptional flexibility for data
          analytics, simulation, workflows and gateways, leveraging interactivity, parallel computing, Spark
          and Hadoop.</li>

      <div id="login"></div>
      <h3>BIL Login Node</h3>    
      <p>The BIL login node provides Command line (ssh terminal) access to BIL data. Everyone who requests
        a BIL account has access to the login node using their BIL Username and Password. The login node is 
        not intended for heavy computation or visualization, but rather to provide convenient shell access to
        BIL data</p>
      <p>To request a BIL account and gain access to the login node, follow 
        <a href="http://www.brainimagelibrary.org/XSEDEportal.html">these instructions</a> to create an 
	XSEDE portal Account. Then, send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> along with your XSEDE Portal Account 
        and the subject "Access to BIL Login Node for data exploration". You will receive an email message 
        once access has been enabled with instructions to set your password. Please allow 24 hours for access
        to be granted.</p> 
      <p> Once access has been granted you may connect using ssh to login.brainimagelibrary.org and log in 
        with your username/password combination.</p>
 
      <h3>BIL VM System</h3>
			<p>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
	       memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
         user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
	       web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
	    <p>The VM system can be set up to support two different remote-desktop models: X2Go and for high-resolution
		     graphics TGX.</a>
      <p>There is a rich suite of open-source and commercial software availiable on the VMs through the 
				modules package. The suite available includes:  C/C++, Java, Python, R, Matlab, Fiji, Vaa3d, and others.
				<p>VMs can also be configured to host web gateways to provide project specific views of data in BIL and 
					to support visualization, APIs, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
			<p>Since customization is involved, existing BIL users should send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> 
				describing their proposed VM usage. BIL staff will be in touch to discuss various options XSEDE Portal Account 
        and the subject "Access to BIL Login Node for data exploration"
				can request VM access

<p><b>All Brain Image Library data is directly accessable on bridges.psc.edu 
and is located on the /bil file system.</b> </p>

      
      
Datasets in BIL are uniquely referred to by a combination of a 16 digit 
unique identifier and the dataset name separated by a period:

&lt;16-digit-unique-identifier>.&lt;Dataset-Name>

The file path to BIL entries will be:
/bil/data/&lt;c1c2&gt;/&lt;c3c4&gt;/&lt;16-digit-unique-identifier&gt;/&lt;Dataset-Name&gt;

<p>
where &lt;c1c2&gt; are replaced by the first and second characters of the unique identifier and &lt;c3c4&gt; are replaced by the third and fourth characters of the unique identifier.

For example, the dataset: abcded0123456789.example_dataset_01 would be found down the following path:

/bil/data/ab/cd/abcdef0123456789/example_dataset_01/

<p>Additional information about Bridges can be found <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges">here.</a></p>
<p><b>Get access to Bridges: </b></p>
<p>You can get access to Bridges in two ways: <a href="#apply"><strong>apply for an allocation</strong></a> if you are faculty, a researcher or educator with a US institution, or <strong><a href="#sadd_user">be added to an existing account</a></strong> if you work with a PI who has an existing Bridges allocation.</p>

<hr />
<div id="apply"></div>
<h3>Apply for an allocation</h3>
<p>We offer two programs to provide access to Bridges. Complete allocation and affiliation information can be found on the <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges/resources/allocations">allocations page</a>, but in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Researchers and educators at a US academic or non-profit research institutions </strong>can apply for Bridges access through the NSF's XSEDE program. <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges/applying-for-a-bridges-account-faq?view=faq&amp;catid=7">The Bridges FAQ </a>provides more information on how to apply to Bridges through XSEDE. Three types of access are available:
<ul>
<li><em>Start-up allocations</em> allow you to explore high-performance computing and Bridges. The application process is streamlined and you can request up to 2500 GPU-hours on Bridges GPU nodes, up to 50,000 core-hours on Bridges' "regular" (128GB memory) nodes, up to 1000 TB-hours on Bridges "large" (3 and 12TB memory) nodes, or any combination of those resources. See <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup</a> for details on applying.</li>
<li><em>Research allocations</em> provide expanded resource limits<em> w</em>hen you are ready to scale up your work. See <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research</a> for details on applying.</li>
<li><em>Coursework allocations</em> supplement educational activities from workshops to semester courses that benefit from the use of high-performance computing.  See <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/education</a> for details on applying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proprietary research</strong> can be accommodated through the <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges/services/corporate-programs">Corporate Affiliates program</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id="sadd_user">Get added to an existing allocation</span></h3>
<p>You can be added to an existing allocation by the PI. You must have an XSEDE Portal account (<a href="https://portal.xsede.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create one here if you don't already have one</a>); once you do, the <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/aswb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PI can submit a request through the Portal to add you to the allocation</a>. The request must specify all resources which you should be given access to. </p>
<p>Every Bridges user needs access to Pylon storage, but it is not granted automatically; it must be specifically requested in the Add User process. </p>
<p>In addition, the PI must specify any other Bridges' resources granted to the allocation that you should have access to. These can include RM nodes, GPU nodes and/or LSM nodes.</p>
<h3>Choose your tools</h3>
