<p>This document outlines a few recommended best practices to structure your data uploads  
   to the Brain Image Library. If you have questions on how to structure 
   your data that is not answered here, please contact the help desk 
   (bil-support@psc.edu).</p>
	    <H3>Perform general file cleanup after data transfer</H3>
	    Be aware that there may be operating system created hidden files transferred 
	    along with your data that should be removed from the BIL landing-zone directory 
	    prior to making your data public. These files may include: 
	    <blockquote>
		<ul>
		 	<li><b>.DS_Store</b> -- An Apple macOS file   
			(for more information see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store</a>)</li>
		    	<li><b>Thumbs.db</b> -- A Microsoft Windows file  
			(for more information see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_thumbnail_cache">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_thumbnail_cache</a>)</li>
	    </ul></blockquote>
	    <H3>Avoid problematic special characters:</h3>
	    Use characters that are generally safe in your filenames.  Avoid special characters in filenames that can be problematic on a unix/linux system.
	    <blockquote>
		    <p><b>Characters that are generally safe to include in filenames:</b>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Underscore <span class="badge bg-success text-light"><u>&nbsp;</u></span></li>
		    	<li>Dash <span class="badge bg-success text-light">-</span> </li>

	    <H3>Only place subdirectories in the root of the landing-zone</h3>
	    <p>The submission portal will create a landing-zone directory for you to upload your data to. 
	    Please do not place files in this root directory, but rather create one or more subdirectories
	    here for each dataset that you are uploading. Then upload each dataset under the
	    subdirectories that you have created. Note that the complete path to the directory that you 
	    have created should be entered in the metadata spreadsheet along with the associated metadata
	    for each dataset. </p>
	    
<h3>Whole brain datasets containing lower-level data</h3>
<p>To tie metadata to an image dataset (a stack of z-planes), each image dataset must be 
   uploaded in a separate subdirectory. For example, if you had an experiment containing
   5 mouse datasets (with sample names of mouse1, mouse2, mouse3, mouse4, mouse5) that
   you wanted to to include as a single submission collection, you would create 5 subdirectories
   in the landing zone for the submission collection, one for each mouse dataset. e.g:
	    </p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse2
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse3
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse4
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse5
</pre>
<p>If you have additional metadata that you want to include, place it in a subdirectory 
called <i>extras</i>:</p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/extras
</pre>
<p>If processed data will also be included, use subdirectories to indicate these different 
procesing levels. Recommended subdirectory names to use would be: <i>raw</i>, 
<i>unstitched</i>, <i>stitched</i>, <i>aligned</i>, and <i>tracings</i>.  (You may also
use otherdescriptive subdirectory names to segregate different processing levels if needed)
For example if stitched data, data aligned to the Allen reference) were included with mouse1:</p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/stitched
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/aligned
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	    
<h3>Whole brain datasets containing only higher-level data</h3>
<p>It is not unusual to make lower-level image data available before the higher-level 
analysis is complete. In this case, use the same sample name as the prior BIL submission and 
a subdirectory to indicate the level of procesing. For example, If SWC tracing files were 
provided for mouse1 above at a later date:  
	    </p>
	    <pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/fef9236f6400b832/mouse1/tracings
</pre>
<p>Note that you would need to create a new submission collection to submit this data at a later date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	    
<h3>Spatial transcriptomic datasets</h3>
<p>We recommend that spatial transcriptomic data contains both the raw and processed image 
   data as well as the processed csvs. Please submit your image data using the following directory structure: </p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/raw/mouse1_sample1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/raw/mouse1_sample2
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/raw/mouse2_sample1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/raw/mouse2_sample2
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/processed/mouse1_sample1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/processed/mouse1_sample2
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/processed/mouse2_sample1
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/mouse1/processed/mouse2_sample2
</pre>
<p>Place your experiment-wide processed data as csv files in a subdirectory 
called <i>processed</i>:</p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/processed
</pre>	    	    
<p>If you have additional metadata that you want to include, place it in a subdirectory 
called <i>extras</i> along with any other notes that you want to include about the data:</p>
<pre>
/bil/lz/testuser/abcdef0123456789/extras
</pre>
