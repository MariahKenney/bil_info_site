  <h3>Center for Biologic Imaging</h3>

  <p>The Center for Biologic Imaging (CBI) is one of the largest optical imaging
  centers in the country. The mission of the Center for Biologic Imaging is to
  provide integrated elite level access and training on infrastructure used for
  research, education, technology development and collaboration in Microscopy,
  Biophotonics and Imaging. The Center is deeply committed to providing open and
  transparent access to the most cutting edge optical imaging equipment to all
  biomedical research faculty, though with priority where access is intended to
  lead to funded collaborations or where funded collaborations pre-exist and
  joint outputs such as co-authored publications, IP filings and grant
  applications will result.</p>

  <h4>Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center</h4>

  <p>The Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center at Carnegie Mellon University is
  a collaboration of biologists, chemists, and imaging scientists developing
  fluorescence technologies for biomedical applications. MBIC is an innovative
  research environment that focuses on development and application of new
  scientific tools. MBIC technologies are used in drug discovery, neuroscience,
  biomedical imaging and cancer biology programs through a variety of
  partnerships. Technologies launched from MBIC include the Cyanine Dyes (Cy3,
  Cy5, Cy7), High Content Screening (Cellomics, Inc), Difference In-Gel
  Electrophoresis (DIGE), Qdots for In-vivo imaging, Fluorogen Activating
  Proteins, and DNA Nanotags.</p>

  <h4>Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center</h4>

  <p>PSC provides university, government and industrial researchers with access
  to several of the most powerful systems for high-performance computing,
  communications and data storage available to scientists and engineers
  nationwide for unclassified research. PSC advances the state of the art in
  high-performance computing, communications and data analytics and offers a
  flexible environment for solving the largest and most challenging problems in
  computational science.</p>
