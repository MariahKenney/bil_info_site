      <H1>Get Your Brain Straight Hackathon</h1> 
			  This page describes site-specific information about the Brain Image Library that hackathon 
			  participants may find useful. If your question is NOT answered here please check to see if 
			  it is answered on the <a href="https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/GetYourBrainStraight/HCK01_2022_Virtual/">
			  main hackathon page</a>.	    
			<h2>BIL Helpdesk</h2>
			The Brain Image Library has a helpdesk, that you should feel free to contact with any problems/issues/or questions. 
			To submit a troubleticket, send email to: <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> . It would be helpful to include that you are
			a hackathon participant in the email message and include the word "Hackathon" in the subject line. 
     
			<h2>Username/Password</H2>
      If you requested an account, you should have received an email from grants@psc.edu with your username and 
      instructions on how to <a href="https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/password.html">change your password</a>. 
      <i>All BIL systems use the same username and password.</i>
      If you can not find the email or do not know what your username is, please email bil-support@psc.edu for assistance.
      
        
      <H2>Hackathon Data</H2>
      The BIL Filesystem, which is a lustre based filesystem, is mounted on all BIL systems at: /bil . 
      The hackathon data itself can be found at:  /bil/proj/hackathon/2022_GYBS/ Please read the README 
			file in this directory for instructions on where to find the data and where to place your results.  
        
      <H2>BIL Hackathon Documentation</H2>
      We highly recommend that participants <a href="https://hackmd.io/@biomed-apps/B1B8mQCb5">review the BIL 
      hackathon documentation</a>. The BIL Hackathon documentation goes over several items to be aware of using 
      the BIL analysis ecosystem, including how to connect using <a href="software/X2Go.html">X2Go</a>
			and connecting through a terminal program using ssh. If you haven't used them before, LMOD and SLURM
			are two <i>important</i>items to review and understand
			from the tutorial: 
        <ul>
        <li>SLURM is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
          scheduling system.</li>
        <li>LMOD is software to manage software emvironments. It is used to make software available for use.</li> 
        </ul>
			  <i> Note: There are a few sample SLURM scripts(aka jobs) that use LMOD Modules that you can examine and 
					submit on the BIL analysis ecosystem at: /bil/proj/hackathon/2022_GYBS/BIL/slurm</i>  
        The hackathon documentation also goes into detail outlining several ways to containerize codes and also
        gives examples on how to run select software packages installed on the BIL system including MATLAB.  
      
      <h2>Analysis Ecosystem</H2>
      <p>The Brain Image Library analysis ecosystem provides an integrated computational and visualization system to  
      explore, visualize, and and access data without having to download it. The underlying operating system runs Unix (CentOS).  
      It consists of several parts including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>BIL Login Node:</b> <i>login.brainimagelibrary.org</i> The BIL login node provides command line, secure 
          shell (ssh) terminal access to BIL data.  The login node is 
          not intended for heavy computation or visualization, but rather to provide convenient shell access to
	        BIL data and enable interactive and batch use of the <u>BIL Computational Cluster</u>. </li>
        <li><b>BIL Workshop Node:</b> <i>workshop.brainimagelibrary.org</i> The BIL Workshop node is a 56 multi-core VM 
          node with about 2.6Tb of memory. It is intended to run desktop-visualization applications. It also acts as a 
          front-end running <i>SLURM and interact</i> to enable interactive and batch use of the 
          <u>BIL Computational Cluster</u>. </li>To run graphical applications, we recommend that you 
          connect using <a href="software/X2Go.html">X2Go</a> The workshop node can be connected to using 
          secure shell (ssh) for users that do not need to run graphical applications.
        <li><b>BIL Workshop GPU Node:</b> <i>workshop2.brainimagelibrary.org</i> The BIL Workshop GPU node is a 
          multi-core (72 physical, 144 virtual cores) machine containing two V100 (32Gb) GPUS and about 1.5Tb of memory. 
	  			To run graphical applications that use the GPUs, we 
          recommend that you connect using <a href="software/X2Go.html">X2Go</a>  The workshop GPU node can 
          also be connected to using secure shell (ssh) for users that do not need to run graphical applications.
				<li><b>BIL Computational Cluster:</b> The BIL Computational cluster consists of eight nodes 
	  			with 3 terabytes of RAM each. The computational cluster runs SLURM and is avaiable for 
          both batch and interactive access from the <u>BIL login node</u> and the <u>BIL Workshop Node</u>.
	  			SLURM jobs can request a maximum of 75 cores per node</li>       
        <li><b>Other Systems:</b> The BIL analysis ecosystem includes other machines that we will 
	  			not be using for the hackathon including personalized VMs, the Bridges2 HPC system, and Neocortex a 
	  			Cerebras advanced AI computing system. If you are interested in these systems, please see 
					<a href="https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/computevisual.html"> this page</a> or contact 
					bil-support@psc.edu
				<li><b>Data Transfer Nodes:</b> <i>upload.brainimagelibrary.org</i> and <i>download.brainimagelibrary.org</i>  
				These dedicated data transfer nodes can be used to move files to and from the BIL filesystem. 
				There are many supported ways to upload and download files into your /bil home directory from 
					the data transfer nodes, including rsync, Globus, sftp, and scp. </li>
			</ul>
<H2>MATLAB Software</H2>
	   <p> If you desire to use MATLAB on the BIL analysis ecosystem please be sure to 
	    <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/software/matlab/permission-form">fill out this form</a> prior to the hackathon if possible.
